  ### For end users

  - **Clean & Minimalistic UI**: A user-friendly interface for RAG-based QA.
  - **Support for Various LLMs**: Compatible with LLM API providers (OpenAI, AzureOpenAI, Cohere, etc.) and local LLMs (via `ollama` and `llama-cpp-python`).
  - **Easy Installation**: Simple scripts to get you started quickly.

  ### For developers

  - **Framework for RAG Pipelines**: Tools to build your own RAG-based document QA pipeline.
  - **Customizable UI**: See your RAG pipeline in action with the provided UI, built with <a href='https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio'>Gradio <img src='https://img.shields.io/github/stars/gradio-app/gradio'></a>.
  - **Gradio Theme**: If you use Gradio for development, check out our theme here: [kotaemon-gradio-theme](https://github.com/lone17/kotaemon-gradio-theme).

  ## Key Features

  - **Host your own document QA (RAG) web-UI**: Support multi-user login, organize your files in private/public collections, collaborate and share your favorite chat with others.

  - **Organize your LLM & Embedding models**: Support both local LLMs & popular API providers (OpenAI, Azure, Ollama, Groq).

  - **Hybrid RAG pipeline**: Sane default RAG pipeline with hybrid (full-text & vector) retriever and re-ranking to ensure best retrieval quality.

  - **Multi-modal QA support**: Perform Question Answering on multiple documents with figures and tables support. Support multi-modal document parsing (selectable options on UI).

  - **Advanced citations with document preview**: By default the system will provide detailed citations to ensure the correctness of LLM answers. View your citations (incl. relevant score) directly in the _in-browser PDF viewer_ with highlights. Warning when retrieval pipeline return low relevant articles.

  - **Support complex reasoning methods**: Use question decomposition to answer your complex/multi-hop question. Support agent-based reasoning with `ReAct`, `ReWOO` and other agents.

  - **Configurable settings UI**: You can adjust most important aspects of retrieval & generation process on the UI (incl. prompts).

  - **Extensible**: Being built on Gradio, you are free to customize or add any UI elements as you like. Also, we aim to support multiple strategies for document indexing & retrieval. `GraphRAG` indexing pipeline is provided as an example.
